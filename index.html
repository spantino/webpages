    <p>
        My name is Sofia Antinozzi, I am a first-year at NC State. 
        I am majoring in engineering, and have not chosen a specific major yet. 
        I am interested in material science engineering because I want to work with prosthetics and biomechanical devices.

        Over the summer I worked as a pharmacy tech at a walgreens near my house. You apparently need very little training or experience to get a job that deals with drugs.
        It was mostly pill counting and customer service. I don't think I would do it long term but it was a nice experience.
